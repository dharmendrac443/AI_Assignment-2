## üîç Environments Used

### 1. **Frozen Lake**
- Environment: `FrozenLake-v1`
- Config: `is_slippery=False`
- Size: `4x4`
- Goal: Reach state 15 from start state 0

### 2. **Ant Maze**
- Custom-built discrete environment
- Modeled as a graph with defined transitions
- Start and goal states specified
- Rendered using `gymnasium` compatible visuals

### 3. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
- 10-city fully connected graph
- Random symmetric distance matrix
- Algorithms return best tour and total path cost

## üß† Algorithms Implemented

### ‚úÖ Search Algorithms

#### 1. **Branch and Bound (B&B)**
- Explores least-cost paths using priority queues
- Avoids cycles and redundant expansions
- Terminates on goal detection or timeout (TAU)

#### 2. **Iterative Deepening A\***
- Combines A\* and iterative deepening
- Uses Manhattan Distance heuristic for grid-based search
- Expands threshold gradually to find optimal path
- More memory-efficient than A\*

### üîß Optimization Algorithms

#### 3. **Hill Climbing**
- Starts with a random TSP solution
- Repeatedly improves by swapping cities
- Stops when local maxima is reached
- Fast but prone to getting stuck

#### 4. **Simulated Annealing**
- Probabilistic optimization for TSP
- Accepts worse moves early to escape local minima
- Cooling schedule reduces randomness over time
- Returns near-optimal path within time constraints

---

## ‚è± Runtime & Evaluation

- Each search algorithm is run **5 times**
- Time limit (`TAU`) is **600 seconds per run**
- Logs include:
  - Whether the goal was reached
  - Time taken
  - Path cost and step count (for search tasks)

## üì¶ Requirements

Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
